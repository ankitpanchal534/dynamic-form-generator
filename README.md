# Dynamic Form Generator Application - React.js

## Description

This React.js application allows users to create custom forms with various types of form fields, such as text inputs, text areas, dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Users can add and remove form fields dynamically, specify field types, set options for dropdowns, and even define validation rules for form fields. Additionally, users can save and load form configurations as JSON data.

## Key Features

### 2. Supported Field Types

- Text Input
- Number
- Email ID
- Text Area

### 3. Dropdown Customization

- For dropdown fields, users can define a set of options to choose from.

### 4. Form Submission and Validation

- The application supports form submission.
- It provides validation for form fields, displaying error messages for invalid entries.

## Additional Challenges (Optional)

### 1. Validation Rules

  - Required fields
  - Specific formats (e.g., email, phone number)
